    <p>
      Above all, awesome co-workers and freedom. Freedom because I believe that
      I dont need to wake up every day at 8am to be productive. Actually, my
      programming skills increase 20% when the sun goes down. Awesome co-workers
      because we spend a lot of time talking and discussing bussiness/technical
      ideias. With all that, comes personal growth and technical skill
      development, which I pretend to increase in every challenge.
