    <p>
      I always liked seeing things happen. Thats why I prefer frontend. In the
      future I would like to combine my passion for space and start integrating
      my knowledge of programming with robotics. I already did some little
      projects with a raspberry pi and some sensors and I would like to deepen
      that knowledge.
