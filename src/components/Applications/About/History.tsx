    <p>
      From stocking shelfs in stores, to a supermarket cashier, to working on
      factory production lines. Jumping from one job to another made me see what
      I didn't want in life. I set out to discover new areas and tried web
      design for 1 year. Made some projects for small companies as a freelancer
      and this got me in touch with programming. Learned the basics, got
      confortable with logic and I got a job as a programming teacher. Two years
      passed by and now I'm a programmer and I want to continue learning and
      build software. It seems like I finally got it right...
