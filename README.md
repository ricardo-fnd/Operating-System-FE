# 🖥️ **BrowserOS**

A browser-based simulation of an operating system — built for fun, learning, and experimentation. 
Each user as its own operating system.
I created this project to explore web technologies, backend logic, and ci/cd, while pushing myself to combine creativity and programming.

## Tech Stack
```
> frontend          : typescript, next.js, react query (caching), tailwind
> backend           : python, fast-api, postgres, redis
> deployment        : vercel (frontend), raspberry-pi (backend)
> infrastructure    : cloudflare (dns, waf, proxy)

```
## Features
```
> apps           : browser, profile

```
